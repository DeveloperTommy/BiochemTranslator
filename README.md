# Biochem Translator Application
##Tommy Nguyen | December 7, 2015


###What is this?
This is an app that I created for my Biochemistry class to translate DNA to RNA strands, find their complements, find the reverse of their complements, and so on. It was created for a final project where we were allowed to do anything encompassing the class, so I decided to try to make a useful tool!

###What was this built with?
This was built on Node with BootStrap, JQuery, and Hover.css. Photography was taken by me.

###Anything for the future?
If there is enough demand, I will continue to work on this after my class has ended for any struggling Biochemistry major.
